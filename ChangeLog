The changes are recorded by the version control system, Darcs. To see a log
quickly from the terminal, run:

  $ darcs changes --repo http://dev.rel4tion.org/fr33domlover/vcs-web-hook-parse

There is also a web interface at <http://darcs.rel4tion.org> which, among other
things, can display the history log.

To see the log in a local clone, first get a copy of the repository if you
haven't yet:

  $ darcs get http://dev.rel4tion.org/fr33domlover/vcs-web-hook-parse

Then move into the newly created directory and run darcs:

  $ cd vcs-web-hook-parse
  $ darcs changes
